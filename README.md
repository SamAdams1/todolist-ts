# TechWise Web Systems Design Competency-Based Assessment

To demonstrate competency in Web Systems Design, you'll have to create a functional "Todo-List" web application demonstrating competency in three main topic areas:

1. **UI**: Your front end must utilize React, Vite, and Typescript.
   - See sessions 0 - 7
2. **Testing**: You must test at least one feature of your app using Jest, Vitest, or Cypress.
   - See sessions 13 - 16
3. **DevOps**: You must containerize at least one service of your app using Docker.
   - See sessions 17 - 19

You are expected to satisfy these minimum viable requirements for a functional "Todo-List" app:

- Create a new Todo, providing its description
- Change the description of a Todo
- Complete a Todo
- Delete a Todo
- View all Todos
- View uncompleted Todos
- View completed Todos

At least one of these features must be tested.

Notice the absence of any backend requirements.
You can choose to create a backend to persist Todos, or you can handle persistence using client side storage.
This design decision will of course have consequences in how you test your app.

### The competency-based option for assessment is a **HIGHER** standard than the participation option, because it _requires achieving functional features_ with our new tools rather than participating in the labs where you are merely required to engage with the tools.

**Submission**: Share your public GitLab repo with Sarah via email to submit.
